## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I work as a Data Analyst Intern at Inforens in London, where I leverage advanced statistical techniques to drive user engagement and retention in the educational sector.

I'm currently pursuing further studies at Queen Mary University of London.

I love connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and sharing my journey, skills, and experiences.
